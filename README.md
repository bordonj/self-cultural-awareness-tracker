Capstone

Overall Review
Name of Student: Jennifer Bordon

Name of Project: Self-/Cultural-Awareness Tracker

Project's Purpose or Goal: Help Users understand themselves, their biases, their triggers better. Hopefully to become more understanding/empathic people.

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

- Profile showing one's demographics
- Journal log of their thoughts to some controversial topics, e.g., race, gender, etc.
- Access lessons to DEI topics e.g., microaggression, stereotype threat

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

- JavaScript
- React
- NoSQL

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

- Quizzes to take on lessons/concepts 
- Option to share results with others if wanted
- Make this mobile

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

- unsure at the moment

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

- N/A
